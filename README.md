All the projects I completed during the FreeCodeCamp HTML &amp; CSS course.
Welcome to my FreeCodeCamp Projects repository! Here, you will find all the coding exercises and projects I’ve completed while learning web development through FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design course and beyond. I created this repository to track my progress, improve my skills, and showcase what I’ve learned so far. Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or reach out if you have any tips or advice. Thank you for visiting!
